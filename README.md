# html_css_js_template3

## Description
  A desire to learn and develop my abilities more and more , in addition to getting ideas for future projects was my motivation 
  This project was a real challenge for me as a beginner, it is the first project 90% made by me i chose it because it had so many sections and the owner added a lot of challenges and excelled in them truly. 
- I was scared of big projects, but now that this one is done, i feel like i can climb to the next level.
- by building this template i've learned alot of tricks in both html and css
